**Who may be interested**

Teachers who want to make unique exam question cards and tired from the process of making them manually.

**How to work with application**

Step 1

To prepare unique exam cards it is necessary to form a question list first. Questions may be divided by topics, complexity, type etc. Question list needs to be saved in csv file with following columns:
    - *No* question number
    - *Question* question
    - *Group* - question type, complexity, topic etc.

Here is an example:

No  Question    Group
1   Question1   Group1
2   Question2   Group1
3   Question3   Group2
4   Question4   Group2
5   Question5   Group3

Step 2

Run the application. It will ask for number of students that are expected to take exam and for number of questions to be included in each group of questions. Be careful number of questions in each group cannot be more than number of questions for selected group in list of questions. Application will check this.

Step 3

Application will save examination cards in txt file. You need just print and cut cards.
